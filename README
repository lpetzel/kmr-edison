Prerequirements:



If you are running debian or raspberry debian the following scripts
will install prerequirements:
prepare/install-dep
prepare/gen-lib



If you do not want to use these scripts, follow this paragraph.
You need to have libprotobuf, libmodbus and libboost installed.
You will probably find them in your systems package manager.

Furthermore you need to have protobuf_comm installed. 
You get the files from the llsf_refbox repository:
http://git.fawkesrobotics.org/llsf-refbox.git
in src/libs/protobuf_comm. Copy the header files to your include path
(I like /usr/local/include/protobuf_comm).
The dynamically linked .so files are already in the repositories lib
directory. However, you might have to recompile them.
To do so go to
 *) http://git.fawkesrobotics.org/llsf-refbox.git
 *) cd src/libs/protobuf_comm
 *) make
 *) cd ../../libs
 *) copy files (protobuf_comm.*) into lib directory
    (or anywhere else in your link path)




How to run the tool?

To test the tool you run 3 programs:
1) Simulate the modbus server:
   cd modbus_server; make run
2) Start main program
   make run_proto_server
3) Fake the refbox
   cd proto_generator; make run

Do it in this order and in three different terminals to see the output.

To run the tool in a real world scenario, execute
./proto_server
with the correct parameters
